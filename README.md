## Introduction

Predicting future sales is a crucial task for businesses to optimize inventory, production, and financial planning. In this project, we utilize Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) implemented with Keras to forecast alcohol sales. The model is trained on time-series data, allowing it to learn patterns and trends in alcohol sales over time. This document provides a step-by-step explanation of the approach taken in the project.

## Data Preprocessing

The first step in building a predictive model is handling and preprocessing the dataset. The dataset, which contains historical alcohol sales data, is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. To ensure that the model receives well-structured input, missing values are checked and handled accordingly. The relevant features (such as time and sales values) are extracted and scaled using MinMaxScaler, which normalizes the values between 0 and 1. Normalization is crucial for improving the performance and convergence speed of the neural network.

## Creating the Training and Testing Sets

Since RNNs are designed to process sequential data, the dataset is split into sequences. A specific time window is chosen to define input features (X), while the corresponding target values (y) are set as the next sales value in the sequence. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, ensuring that past data is used for training while future data is reserved for validation and performance evaluation.

## Building the RNN Model

The model is built using Keras' Sequential API. The architecture consists of:

Input layer: Accepts time-series input data.

LSTM Layer: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer is used to capture temporal dependencies in the dataset. LSTMs are a special kind of RNN that help mitigate vanishing gradient problems and learn long-term patterns in data.

Dense Layer: A fully connected layer is added to produce the final output.

Activation Function: The activation function in the final layer is set appropriately for regression tasks, typically a linear activation function.

Loss Function and Optimizer: The model is compiled using a loss function (such as Mean Squared Error) and an optimizer (like Adam) to minimize prediction errors.

## Training the Model

Once the architecture is defined, the model is trained on the training dataset. The training process involves feeding the input sequences into the RNN and adjusting the weights based on the loss function's feedback. The number of epochs and batch size are carefully chosen to optimize model performance while avoiding overfitting.

## Evaluating Model Performance

After training, the model is tested on the validation dataset. Predictions are generated, and the performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Additionally, the predicted sales values are plotted alongside actual values to visually assess how well the model captures trends in alcohol sales.

## Forecasting Future Sales

Once the model is validated, it is used to make future sales predictions. The last known sales data is fed into the trained model to generate predictions for upcoming time periods. These forecasts help businesses make informed decisions regarding inventory and supply chain management.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using RNNs, specifically LSTMs, for time-series forecasting. The step-by-step implementation covers data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and forecasting. By leveraging deep learning techniques, businesses can enhance their ability to predict future sales trends and make data-driven decisions. Future improvements can involve tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different RNN architectures, or incorporating additional external factors to enhance prediction accuracy.
